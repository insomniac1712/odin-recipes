    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour, water, salt, and yeast until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>

    </ul>
   <h3>Shape the Dough</h3>

        <li>Grate the Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Bake the Pizza</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <li>Transfer the pizza to the preheated oven (or pizza stone) and bake for about 7-10 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Serve!</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Drizzle a bit more olive oil over the top if desired.</li>
        <li>Slice and enjoy your authentic Neapolitan pizza!</li>
    </ul>
